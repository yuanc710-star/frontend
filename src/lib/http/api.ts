/**
 * Single entry point for calls to our BFF resource API (versioned `/vN/*`).
 *
 * WHEN TO USE WHICH
 * -----------------
 *  - `apiFetch(path, init)` → for every actual `/vN` data read or write. This is
 *    the only client that should ever touch the `/vN` resource API. Use
 *    `interactive: true`
 *    (default) on protected pages so a mid-session expiry pops the re-auth modal;
 *    use `interactive: false` for passive/ambient reads that may run while logged
 *    out (header user info, account nav, meta vocab) where a 401 just means
 *    "not signed in" and must NOT nag an anonymous visitor with the modal.
 *  - `getSession()` (see ./session) → only to answer "is the user logged in?" for
 *    a render decision. It hits `/auth/session` (not a `/vN` resource), never
 *    opens the modal. Don't use `apiFetch` for that probe — `apiFetch` rejects
 *    any non-versioned path by design.
 *
 * HOW TO USE
 * ----------
 *   const res = await apiFetch("/v1/userinfo");                 // protected read
 *   const res = await apiFetch("/v1/userinfo", { interactive: false }); // ambient
 *   const res = await apiFetch("/v1/guide/profile", {           // mutation
 *     method: "PATCH",
 *     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
 *     body: JSON.stringify(payload),
 *   });
 * Returns the `Response` (check `res.ok` yourself). With `interactive: true` it
 * may reject with `AuthCancelledError` if the user dismisses the re-auth modal.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR
 * ---------
 * - Least privilege: only accepts internal BFF paths and sends credentials
 *   `same-origin` (never to third-party origins).
 * - Re-auth is signalled explicitly by the BFF: only `401` WITH
 *   `Auth-Required: reauthenticate` opens the sign-in modal (via the auth gate).
 *   A plain `401`/`403` (e.g. an authorization failure) is returned to the
 *   caller and does NOT trigger re-auth.
 * - Safe methods (GET/HEAD) retry once after re-auth; mutations are not replayed
 *   automatically (set `retryAfterAuth` only when the BFF endpoint is
 *   idempotent). In our modal UX the user re-auths via a same-tab redirect, so
 *   the page unloads and the retry is effectively a no-op — but it stays correct
 *   for any future in-place re-auth.
 * - `interactive: false` opts a call OUT of the modal: a re-auth 401 is returned
 *   as-is so the caller can read it as "logged out". This lets ambient reads in
 *   a public / possibly-signed-out context (header, account nav, session probes)
 *   share the SAME client — with its versioned-path + `same-origin` guarantees —
 *   without nagging an anonymous visitor with the sign-in modal.

/**
 * BFF resource paths are versioned ("/v1/…", "/v2/…", …). Match any version

 * versioned BFF paths (never absolute/third-party URLs) go through this client.
