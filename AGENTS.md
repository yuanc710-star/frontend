# Agent & contributor guide

Conventions in this repo are **enforced by CI** — skipping them blocks the merge.
If you (human or AI agent) open a PR, follow these.

## Pull requests

Fill out the PR description using `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The required
`pr-template` check needs:

- a non-empty **## Summary**
- a non-empty **## Testing** section
- at least one **## Type of change** box checked (`- [x]`)

The template is **not** auto-applied when a PR is created via `gh pr create` or by an
agent, so pass a `--body` that includes those sections yourself.

## Commits

Conventional Commits **plus a Jira ticket**:

    <type>: <BOARD>-<NUMBER> <description>
    e.g. feat: CTL-1234 add Google OIDC callback

Types: `feat fix docs style refactor perf test build ci chore revert`.
Enforced by a local `commit-msg` hook (installed on first `./mvnw` / `npm install`).

## What blocks a merge

- `ci` — unit + integration tests, project coverage gate, and ≥80% patch coverage on changed lines
- `pr-template` — the PR-description checks above
- a pull request is required (no direct push to `main`) with **1 approving review**
